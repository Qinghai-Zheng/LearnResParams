### Getting the data

To run the experiments, the top 10 communities for each SNAP dataset need to be extracted. Details on how to put data in the right format can be found at:

[https://github.com/nveldt/FlowSeed/tree/master/Exp1-snap-communities]()

### Learning resolution parameters

Run `snap-top10-learn-alpha.jl`

### Output

Plots and a table of results can be obtained by running
`plots_scatter.m` and `print_results.m`.
